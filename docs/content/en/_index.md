Opni Monitoring is an open-source multi-cluster monitoring platform. It ingests Prometheus metrics from any number of Kubernetes clusters and provides a centralized observability plane for your infrastructure. Use Opni Monitoring to visualize metrics from all your clusters at once, and give every user their own customized view using granular access control.

## âš¡ Powered by Open-Source

Opni Monitoring is completely free Apache-licensed open-source software. It builds upon existing, ubiquitous open-source systems - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), [Grafana](https://grafana.com), and [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io) - and extends them with a number of powerful enterprise features typically only found in SaaS platforms and other proprietery solutions.

## ðŸ”‹ Batteries Included

Opni Monitoring comes out of the box with all the tools you need to get started with multi-cluster monitoring. Manage your clusters and configure access control rules with the built-in dashboard, command-line interface, or REST API. 

Opni Monitoring is secure-by-default and uses a zero-trust architecture for inter-cluster communication, with no extra setup required.

## ðŸ”’ You Own Your Data

With Opni Monitoring, you have complete control over how and where your data is stored. Metric storage is powered by [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io), which provides comprehensive configuration options for data storage and retention. Several storage backends are available including S3 (cloud or self-hosted), Swift, and Kubernetes Persistent Volumes.
